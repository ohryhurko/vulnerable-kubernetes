# Offensive Security Engineer Interview Guide

This document provides instructions for conducting security assessments using this vulnerable Kubernetes cluster.

## Overview

This cluster contains intentionally vulnerable applications and configurations designed to test various aspects of Kubernetes security knowledge and offensive security skills.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Local Development Environment

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Kubernetes cluster (minikube, kind, or local cluster)
   - kubectl configured
   - Helm installed

2. **Setup**:
   ```bash
   bash setup-vulnerable-cluster.sh
   bash access-cluster.sh
   ```

3. **Access**: Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:1234

### Option 2: Google Cloud Platform (Recommended for Interviews)

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - GCP account with billing enabled
   - gcloud CLI installed and configured
   - kubectl installed

2. **Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd platforms/gcp-setup
   export PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
   bash setup-gcp-cluster.sh
   cd ../../
   bash setup-vulnerable-cluster.sh
   bash access-cluster.sh
   ```

3. **Access**: Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:1234

### Option 3: Isolated Interview Environment

For conducting interviews with multiple candidates:

```bash
export CANDIDATE_NAME="John Doe"
export INTERVIEW_ID="20241201-001"
bash setup-interview-environment.sh
bash access-interview-20241201-001.sh
```

## Assessment Scenarios

The cluster contains various security vulnerabilities across different categories:

### 1. Application Security
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Hardcoded secrets and credentials
- **Insecure APIs**: Vulnerable endpoints and authentication bypass
- **Container Vulnerabilities**: Outdated base images and packages

### 2. Kubernetes Security
- **RBAC Misconfigurations**: Overprivileged service accounts
- **Network Security**: Insecure network policies and exposed services
- **Pod Security**: Privileged containers and host access

### 3. Infrastructure Security
- **Container Registry**: Insecure registry configurations
- **Resource Management**: Resource exhaustion vulnerabilities
- **Monitoring**: Inadequate logging and monitoring

## Interview Assessment Criteria

### Technical Skills (40%)
- **Kubernetes Knowledge**: Understanding of K8s architecture and security concepts
- **Container Security**: Knowledge of container vulnerabilities and hardening
- **Network Security**: Understanding of network policies and service mesh security
- **RBAC**: Ability to identify and exploit privilege escalation

### Methodology (30%)
- **Reconnaissance**: Systematic approach to information gathering
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Ability to identify and categorize vulnerabilities
- **Exploitation**: Practical demonstration of attack techniques
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation of findings and impact

### Communication (20%)
- **Technical Communication**: Ability to explain complex security concepts
- **Risk Assessment**: Understanding of business impact and risk prioritization
- **Remediation**: Practical recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities

### Problem Solving (10%)
- **Adaptability**: Ability to work with unfamiliar tools and environments
- **Creativity**: Innovative approaches to security testing
- **Persistence**: Determination to find and exploit vulnerabilities

## Expected Findings

Candidates should be able to identify and demonstrate exploitation of:

1. **Privilege Escalation**: Exploiting overprivileged service accounts
2. **Container Escape**: Breaking out of containers to access host systems
3. **Network Attacks**: Exploiting insecure network configurations
4. **Data Exfiltration**: Accessing sensitive data and secrets
5. **Service Disruption**: Causing denial of service through resource exhaustion
6. **Lateral Movement**: Moving between services and namespaces

## Time Allocation

- **Setup and Reconnaissance**: 15-20 minutes
- **Vulnerability Identification**: 20-30 minutes
- **Exploitation Demonstration**: 30-45 minutes
- **Documentation and Reporting**: 15-20 minutes
- **Discussion and Q&A**: 10-15 minutes

**Total Time**: 90-130 minutes

## Cleanup

After the interview, ensure all resources are cleaned up:

### Local Environment:
```bash
bash teardown-cluster.sh
```

### GCP Environment:
```bash
cd platforms/gcp-setup
bash teardown-gcp-cluster.sh
```

### Interview Environment:
```bash
bash teardown-interview-[INTERVIEW_ID].sh
```

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**

1. **Isolation**: This cluster should be completely isolated from production environments
2. **Access Control**: Limit access to authorized personnel only
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor all activities during the assessment
4. **Cleanup**: Always clean up resources after the interview
5. **Documentation**: Document all activities for audit purposes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Pods Not Starting**: Check resource availability and image pull policies
2. **Port Forwarding Issues**: Verify pod status and port configurations
3. **Permission Errors**: Ensure proper RBAC and service account configurations
4. **Network Issues**: Check network policies and service configurations

### Getting Help

- Check Kubernetes documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/
- Verify cluster status: `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`
- Check service status: `kubectl get services --all-namespaces`
- Review logs: `kubectl logs [pod-name] -n [namespace]`

## Success Metrics

A successful candidate should demonstrate:

- ✅ Ability to identify multiple vulnerability types
- ✅ Practical exploitation of at least 3-4 vulnerabilities
- ✅ Clear documentation of findings and impact
- ✅ Practical remediation recommendations
- ✅ Understanding of Kubernetes security best practices
- ✅ Professional communication and presentation skills

## Post-Interview

1. **Documentation**: Collect all findings and recommendations
2. **Cleanup**: Ensure all resources are properly cleaned up
3. **Feedback**: Provide constructive feedback to the candidate
4. **Follow-up**: Schedule any necessary follow-up discussions
